STILL WON'T WORK. See: https://github.com/yahoo/messenger-sdk/issues#issue/2

I'm now trying to use OpenYMSG: http://sourceforge.net/projects/openymsg/

--------------------------------

This SDK provides an interface to the Yahoo! Messenger API (http://developer.yahoo.com/messenger/) and a sample GUI app both written in Java.

The Messenger SDK contains certain 3rd party open source libraries and tools.  This file summarizes the tools used, their purpose, and the licenses under which they're released.  

The following 3rd party software package is not distributed as part of this project, but instead is separately downloaded from the respective provider and is only used as part of the separately packaged example code which illustrate how the SDK may be used:

* Light Weight UI Toolkit (LWUIT)
Licensed under GPL with classpath exception
(https://lwuit.dev.java.net/) 

----------------------

The following 3rd Party code is included as part of this Project:

* json in Java version 0.5   See http://www.json.org
